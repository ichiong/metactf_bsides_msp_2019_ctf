# Getting the Gist of Recon

By now, you're really getting the gist of all this recon - I'm surprised you haven't started tweeting about it yet! Goodness knows everyone (malware authors included) use Twitter. Anyways, we recently picked up this suspicious pastebin paste that didn't have much info in it. We think it might be connected to malware though. Perhaps you can do some digging?

__Hint:__ Maybe you'll git another flag soon too!
