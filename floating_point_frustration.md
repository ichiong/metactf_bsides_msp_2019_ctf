# Floating Point Frustration

DNScorp engineers love coming up with random algorithms. Sometimes they're not the most efficient algorithms, but they're good at generating large values. However, we've discovered a bug in [this program](https://problems.metactf.com/rvasec2019/generator), and as a result we keep getting a floating point exception when we run it! We no longer have the original source code, but maybe there's a way to see what values this code produces?
Note: You only have 3 attempts for this problem, so make sure your answer is correct!

__Hint:__ Before main, there was code that needed patching. If all goes well, this program will print the flag out for you!
