# The Impossible Survey

Your company just developed a new product, and before releasing it to the public, they hoped to gauge the reactions from their employees through a [survey](https://forms.gle/EXbMd2jyVKYfE3Wv9). As an incentive, the participants get a gift card after completing it. A company-wide email was sent a while ago, yet no one has submitted the survey or claimed the gift card code. Can you be the first one?
