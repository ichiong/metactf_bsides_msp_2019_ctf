# Not So Equal

Comparing strings is different across programming languages. In Python, it's a simple "String" == "String". In Java, you would use "String".compareTo("String"). PHP developers sometimes use the strcmp() function. Could there be a problem? Visit this [Fun Flag Guessing Page](https://problems.metactf.com/content/not_equal/vulnpage.php) and check yourself!

__Hint:__ Is there a difference betweeen == and === in PHP?
