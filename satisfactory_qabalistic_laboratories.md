# Satisfactory Qabalistic Laboratories

Your company has a bunch of lab equipment lying around for their employees' recreational use, but people are constantly taking petri dishes and not returning them or leaving test tubes dirty. Pete from HR graciously volunteered to make an [internal website](https://problems.metactf.com/content/sq-labs/) for reserving the equipment, but unfortunately you were banned from using it after a mishap with a microscope. You desperately need a test tube for a new project, though. Can you figure out how to log in?

__Hint:__ Can you search for something interesting? :)
